Tyler Is The Name
========================
This is a project to improve my resume based on my (exotic) needs and the fact that I need people to turn to for improvements

I will display additional information in this repository, profiling myself, to help aid in the development of this resume!

My resume is not VERY unique and is released to the Public Domain with a fall back to the WTFPL so please feel free to use it for your own needs: Develop your own, Use for character development, or whatever else you could possibly benefit from.

Any suggestions please feel free to comment, pull, push, or otherwise tell me how bad I did and where I did it.

THANK YOU
